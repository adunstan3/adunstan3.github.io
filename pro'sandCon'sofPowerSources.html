    <h2 class = "sectionTitle">Hydro Power</h2>
    <p>Hydropower creates electricity from the potential energy of water in a reservoir. Hydropower is a renewable resource and doesn't emit carbon. This makes it a good choice for combating climate change. The main pro that separates it from other renewable energy sources like wind and solar is that hydropower can produce electricity on demand. The water reservoir acts as one giant battery that lets hydropower run any time of the day or night. This helps meet our grid's peak demand. Before large-scale grid battery packs were feasible, hydropower was seen as necessary to provide electricity when the wind didn't blow and the sun didn't shine. A side benefit of hydropower is that the reservoir can be used as a predictable water source for citizens who live nearby. The reservoir can also be used for recreation. </p>

    <p>Hydropower, unfortunately, has several downsides. The first is that they are large and expensive to build. There is a lot of funding and permitting that needs to happen to build hydropower. This is unfortunate when we are trying to transition to renewables as quickly as possible. Hydro plants are also very invasive. During construction, they turn large areas of the riverbank into a reservoir. This changes ecosystems and can displace residents. China forced 1.3 million people to relocate before flooding their land to build the Three Gorges dam. In the United States, they suffer from the nimby syndrome. Dams also break the flow of the river. The turbine will kill organisms trying to move downstream, and organisms trying to move upstream will run into a wall. Well-designed dams have overcome this with the use of fish ladders. These are small channels to the dam's sides where fish can climb up or swim down short steps. Dams also have the potential to fail and cause major flooding downstream. The final con that dams suffer from is sedimentation. When water enters the reservoir, it slows down, and the sediment it carried can percolate out and build up over time. Eventually, we must remove this sediment, or the dam will overflow and fail. </p>

    <h2 class = "sectionTitle">Nuclear Power  </h2>
    <p>Nuclear power harnesses the energy from nuclear fission of uranium. Uranium is nonrenewable, but it is carbon-free. This still makes it important to consider in an effort to slow climate change. The one significant advantage of uranium is its incredible energy density. One uranium fuel pellet, which typically is less than a cubic inch by volume, holds as much energy as a ton of coal. There are some applications where nuclear is the only sensible option. The most notable of these is for powering submarines. </p>

    <p>Large groups of protestors are calling for the removal of nuclear energy. The main con of nuclear power is that it produces nuclear waste. If this waste is not contained correctly, then it can cause massive environmental and societal harm. Scientists estimate the Chernobyl will not be safe for human resettlement for another 20,000 years. Nuclear waste that we keep contained will take even longer to be safe at 1 million years. The United States has built a long-term containment site called Yucca mountain in Nevada. There is a significant risk with transporting waste from all over the country since many roads lead through highly populated areas. Containment sites also have the potential to be a target for terrorism. Uranium mining and refining produces tailings that can have negative environmental impacts if not handled properly. </p>

    <h2 class = "sectionTitle">Fossil Fuels </h2>
    <p>Fossil fuels release the energy trapped in ancient compressed organic matter. Fossil fuels have traditionally had significant pros, leading to them becoming the primary energy source for our society. Two big pros are that they are readily abundant and very cost-effective. As we begin to use up the readily available fossil fuels, these pros are becoming less significant. Companies are being forced to look for more and more obscure sources of fuel which is cutting into profit. Solar recently reached price parity with fossil fuels. Another significant advantage of fossil fuels is that they can produce power on demand. This allows them to be turned on during high demand and off during times of low need. Grid storage is starting to be rolled out, which will diminish the benefits from this pro. The final pro is that fossil fuels are very energy-dense. They are certainly more energy-dense than batteries which makes them ideal for situations where weight is essential. With the creation of lithium-ion batteries, battery energy density has increased, but it is nowhere near fossil fuels. Until recently, fossil fuels were the only option for cars and boats. They will continue to be the only option for planes in the near future. </p>

    <p>The main disadvantage of fossil fuels is CO2. We are taking carbon that hasn’t been a part of the carbon cycle for hundreds of thousands of years and dumping it back into the cycle in just a couple of centuries. This has lots of negative impacts that I talk about here:
      <a class = "learnMore" href="effectsofIncreasedTemperature.html">
      <span class = "lm">LM</span>
      <span class = "discription">Effects of Increased Temperature</span> </a>

      The other significant disadvantage of fossil fuels is that we will eventually run out of them. We are using them way faster than they are being created, and they will become prohibitively expensive as we use the easy-to-gather sources. This means that we will have to transition to a renewable energy source at some point. Even if fossil fuels were emission-free, this would still be disruptive. The quicker this transition needs to happen, the more negative impacts it will have on the economy and society. </p>

    <p>Gathering fossil fuels has adverse side effects that are separate from the effects of burning them. Deepwater drilling has obvious negative impacts, as seen with the deepwater horizon explosion. Oil spills are detrimental to organisms that need to interact with the surface of the water. Fracking has the potential to open up a new source of natural gas, but it also has the potential to contaminate groundwater and surface water. It uses a slurry of toxic chemicals to break up the rocks being mined. Any mining produces tailings, and coal mining is no different. If these tailings aren’t handled properly, they can escape and pollute nearby waterways. As coal has become rarer, we are forced to use more invasive techniques to get to it. The most drastic of these is mountaintop removal, where the surface of mountains is blasted away to expose veins underneath. Before and after pictures of this technique look post-apocalyptic. </p>

    <h2 class = "sectionTitle">Wind Turbines</h2>
    <p>Wind turbines capture energy from the wind. They are renewable and don't produce emissions, making them an essential tool in the fight against climate change. They are more straightforward and quicker to construct than traditional power plants, and they have a low impact on their surrounding environment. In areas with consistent and high wind, they are a terrific energy source. Denmark is known for being windy, and on the occasional extremely windy day, its turbines can generate enough energy to power the entire country. </p>

    <p>Wind turbines do have some cons. The first is that the blades' spinning is quite noisy, so they have to be located a little away from people's homes. Noise pollution has negative impacts on species that rely on the use of sound. Wind turbines need to be placed in areas that receive high wind. Mountain ranges are often perfect places for them. This placement creates reluctance from some people that think that turbines ruin the look of the skyline. Turbines can also be harmful to flying species. They kill birds that get too close and are particularly dangerous to bats that have a hard time seeing them with echolocation. </p>

    <h2 class = "sectionTitle">Solar Power </h2>
    <p>Solar panels capture energy from the sun. They are renewable and don’t produce emissions. Solar panels have steadily been coming down in price and are now, on average cheaper than fossil fuels. Solar panels are straightforward to install and can be installed in small enough scales that individuals can have personal solar systems. This, combined with improvements in energy storage, means that producing your power is feasible. The main environmental benefit of this is that there is no energy loss from long-distance transmission lines. Solar panels are also able to be installed on roofs that are currently largely unused spaces. Solar panels have the potential to be deployed rapidly with few regulatory hurdles. </p>

    <p>The main disadvantages of solar power are the impacts on manufacturing and the effects of land use. Large solar farms are not as destructive as concrete structures, but they certainly impact the ecosystems they are built on. There is potential for this impact to be limited by building farms on top of ecologically damaged land such as old mining sites. The manufacturing process uses acetone and several types of acid, which can be hazardous to workers, locals, and the surrounding environment. Solar panels do have a finite life span of around 25-30 years, after which they need to be replaced and recycled. </p>
