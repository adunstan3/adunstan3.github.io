# 205 Galaga
Lowell Deschenes, Sam Pitonyak, Andrew Dunstan
---
For our final project, we are working on an implementation of the arcade game Galaga.
The bulk of the work is done in javascript with the p5 animation library. We save
high scores using google firebase. Because we use firebase for scores, we can keep
the project as a static website. We are hosting on github's static hosting service.

### Running our code:
We are using content delivery networks to load our libraries. This means you can
download and run the source code without worrying about dependencies.
We are using image assets in the project, which means you will need to put the
site on a live server on your localhost. This is simple to do.
- [Webstorm instructions](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2013/03/built-in-server-in-webstorm-6/)
- [Atom instructions](https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server)
- [NPM instructions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) (Works for every editor)

If you don't need the code to run on your machine, then follow the link to view
our progress.
