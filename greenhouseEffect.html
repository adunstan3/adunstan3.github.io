    <h1>Greenhouse Effect</h1>

    <p>The greenhouse effect is similar to greenhouses which create artificially warm environments for plants. Greenhouses are built out of a particular type of plastic that lets visible light through but absorbs infrared light.

       By letting some energy enter and blocking other energy from leaving, the greenhouse collects energy. After enough time in the sun, the greenhouse eventually reaches a maximum temperature and stops collecting energy. The more energy that the greenhouse holds, the more it pushes out until a balance is reached between incoming energy and outgoing energy. If we were to add another layer of plastic, the temperature in the greenhouse will increase. If we took away the original layer, the temperature would cool off because infrared light would be able to leave without as much obstruction. </p>

    <p>Our atmosphere creates a similar effect. The atmospheric greenhouse effect is why it is warm enough for anything to survive. Without the greenhouse effect, the earth's surface temperature would be around 0 degrees Fahrenheit, and humans would have never evolved. In our atmosphere, greenhouse gasses

       take the place of the sheet of plastic. Greenhouse gasses don't interact with visible light from the sun, letting it pass right through. This light hits the earth and is absorbed heating the planet. The earth then radiates infrared light out back into space. The greenhouse gasses can interact with infrared light, and they absorb some of it before it can escape. This means the energy leaving earth is less than the energy entering the earth. The planet heats up and pushes out more IR to reestablish balance.

    <p>The more greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere can trap more infrared light before it escapes into space. Humans have been adding greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere
