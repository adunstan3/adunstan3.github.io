    <h1>Long Tail Pipe</h1>
    <p><span class = "definition">Quick Def:</span> Argues that EV's don't provide any benefit if your power source relies on carbon emissions. This argument overlooks the energy efficiencies of electric vehicles and the ability for EVs to become greener as the power grid transitions to renewables. </p>

    <p>The term "Long Tail Pipe" refers to the idea that even though EVs don't emit carbon while operating, the tailpipe is just longer stretching back to the power plant. The majority of power produced in the United States is indeed from fossil fuels.

      It is also true that the percentage of our electricity supplied by solar is growing. As the grid transitions to sustainable carbon-free sources, the EVs become greener while ICE cars do not. This advantage alone would be enough to put a stop to complaints about a long tailpipe. That said, EVs do have other efficiencies. </p>

    <p>Even if our energy grid were 100% fossil fuels and stayed 100% fossil fuels forever, it would still be better for the environment to drive an EV. This is because EVs are far more energy-efficient than ICE cars. With an EV the fossil fuels are being burned in an industrial power plant. Power plants are enormous structures that have an economic incentive to burn fuel as efficiently as possible. Internal combustion engines have to be small enough to be carried around on four wheels everywhere you go. Until recently, with regulation and consumer awareness, vehicle engineers didn't have a significant incentive to maximize efficiency. The average engine uses 20% of the energy released from combustion to increase the car's forward motion. The rest of the energy is lost to heat and noise. The average fossil fuel plant gets efficiencies of 37%, and plants specialized for efficiency called combined-cycle gas-fired plants can reach 55%.</p>

    <p>Electric vehicles also have a benefit called regenerative braking. During braking, the motor is spun in the opposite direction and becomes a generator.

      Forward momentum of the car is converted into electricity to charge the battery. With ICE cars, the energy from braking is turned into heat on the brake pads and is lost. Electric motors can also be turned off and on very quickly compared to ICE. When stopped at a red light, the electric motors can shut off while internal combustion engines have to sit idling and waste fuel. These advantages that electric motors provide are part of the reason why hybrids are so efficient. </p>
