    <h1>Electric Motors and Generators</h1>
    <p><span class = "definition">Quick Def:</span> Electric motors turn electricity into rotation, and electric generators turn rotation into electricity. Motors and generators have very similar designs. A generator is a motor optimized to work in reverse. </p>

    <p>Without electric motors and electric generators, our modern way of life would not be possible. Electric generators are responsible for creating 97% of the United States electricity. Nearly all of our electricity comes from turning energy into a rotational force that runs a generator. Electric motors are responsible for the home and industry automation all around us. Electric motors acount 45% of all energy use globally. DC and AC motors have instant torque with no exhaust making them perfect for both factories and home appliances. Stepper motors are able to rotate in exact amounts, which has enabled safe and usable robots. More recently, electric motors are used to power electric vehicles, which can cut out a significant source of carbon emissions.

    <p>Motors and Generators use the following principle. A change in a magnetic field produces an electric field, and that a change in an electric field makes a magnetic field. This is the same principle that creates light.

    <p>Motors use a change in an electric field to create a magnetic field. They use electricity to move electrons through a coil of wire, creating an electromagnet. This magnetic field pushes against permanent magnets, causing a spin. Motors have lots of coils of wire oriented at different angles. These coils have the potential to create electromagnets that face different directions. Motors first power a coil that is at an angle to the magnets. The magnetism moves the electromagnet so that it is parallel to the permanent magnets creating a bit of rotation. The motor then unpowers the parallel coil and powers a different coil that has now become offset. Through clever engineering, the motor always powers offset coils that then always move towards the permanent magnet. This creates a continuous rotation. </p>

    <p>Generators use a change in a magnetic field to produce an electric field. They have a very similar construction to a motor. With a generator, an external force source spins either the magnets or the coils.

       The magnetic field is now moving in relation to the coils. This changing magnetic field pushes electrons through the coil. This movement of electrons is electricity. The electricity then flows out of the generator and into the electrical grid, where it is either stored in batteries or used immediately. </p>

    <p>There are optimizations to the core design depending on if the device will be used for a generator or a motor. That said, you could turn any motor into a generator, and you could turn any generator into a motor. This concept is what allows for regenerative braking in electric vehicles. This is where the car's motor is turned into a generator while breaking, and the battery pack is recharged. The momentum of the vehicle is turned back into electricity. Regenerative braking is one of the improvements that make electric vehicles so energy efficient.
