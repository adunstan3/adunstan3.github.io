    <h1>Electromagnetic Radiation</h1>
    <p><span class = "definition">Quick Def:</span> Electromagnetic radiation sounds scary and complicated, but it describes everyday things. Visible light, radio waves, and microwaves are all examples of EM radiation. EM radiation is a wave that oscillates between an electric part and a magnetic part.  </p>

    <p>Electricity and magnetism exist in static and changing forms. A refrigerator magnet demonstrates the static type of magnetism, and the static form of electricity can be seen in well… static electricity. Magnets and static electricity create magnetic and electric fields that can affect the world around them. Magnets push on each other, and static electricity moves your hair. These magnetic fields can be static, but they also can change. They can switch from exerting a positive force to a negative force and vice versa. </p>

    <p>One of the rules of our universe is that changing fields can generate other changing fields. When an electric field changes from + to -, the electric field creates a changing magnetic field. When a magnetic field changes from + to -, an electric field is created.  </p>

    <p>Even though changing fields are less intuitive than static fields, there are still many examples in our world. We utilize magnetic fields creating electric fields in generators. Electric generators spin magnets in circles to make a change in a magnetic field that produces an electric field. The electric field pushes electrons down a wire and creates electricity.

      This is how the bulk of your power is produced. We utilize electric fields creating magnetic fields with electromagnets. Electromagnets force a flow of electrons to move in a spiral creating a changing electric field. This spiraling electric field creates a magnetic field that is used to exert a magnetic force. Electromagnets can be turned off and on and have the potential to be far more powerful than physical magnets. You can create an electromagnet by coiling wire around a nail and hooking both ends to a battery. Powerful electric motors commonly use electromagnets.

    <p>The fact that changing electric fields create magnetic fields and that changing magnetic fields create electric fields has the potential to create a self-sustaining cycle. If the conditions are right, electric can create magnetic, which produces electric, and on and on it goes. This cycle is a self-propagating wave. It oscillates from positive to negative and from electric to magnetic all by its self. This wave is called electromagnetic radiation, also known as light. </p>

    <p>This self-perpetuating process doesn’t need matter to happen, which allows light to carry energy in a vacuum. This wave travels at the speed of light, which is constant. All EM radiation travels at light speed, but the rate of the oscillations from positive to negative and back differ. The rate of this oscillation is called frequency. The frequency of different radiations causes them to interact with the world in different ways. EM radiation is light, and all light travels at the same speed. Because the speed of light is constant, if we know how fast the radiation is going through these cycles, we can find the distance in space traveled during one cycle. This distance is called the wavelength. Differences in frequency and wavelength allow different types of radiation to have different properties.  </p>
