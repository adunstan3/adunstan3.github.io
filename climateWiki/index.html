      <p>Welcome to the Climate Change Wiki. This site is a collection of short write-ups on various topics related to climate change. It has a wiki/zettelkasten structure which means there are links everywhere connecting related ideas. As I write more, these links will form a rich web and become a tool for deeper understanding. I appreciate understanding the fundamentals of how things work, so this site explores topics from physics and chemistry as they relate to climate change. The links look like this.
        <a class = "learnMore" href="empty.html">
        <span class = "lm">LM</span>
        <span class = "discription">Sample Link</span> </a>
         They are abbreviated LM for "learn more." If you hover over them, they expand and tell you where they lead. For each write-up, links to sources are at the bottom.
         <p>
         Three sources guided this entire project that I would like to mention here. These are the global warming class taught at UVM by Dr. Carol Adair, the blog Wait But Why written by Tim Urban, and the IPCC reports assembled by hundreds of climate scientists.
         </p>

         I recommend that you start exploring this site here.
