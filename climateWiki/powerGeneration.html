    <h1>Power Generation</h1>
    <p><span class = "definition">Quick Def:</span> Power generation is taking energy in our environment and changing it into a more helpful form for humans: electricity.</p>

    <div class="line"> </div>
    <br>

    <p>There is a rule in thermodynamics called the conservation of energy. It states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only transition from one form to another. Energy exists in lots of forms all around us. Potential energy, kinetic energy, chemical energy, heat, and light are all forms of energy. Some of these forms of energy are very useful to us already. Heat keeps us warm, and light lets us see, and chemical energy gives us food. </p>

    <p>As we have progressed as a species, we have discovered ways to harness different types of energy. In pre-industrial times waterwheels and windmills let us use kinetic energy to do useful work. In the 1800s, we started to convert the energy around us into a far more useful form: electricity. Electricity is a form of energy created by the movement or the accumulation of electrons. Electricity is clearly beneficial for us. We can store it in batteries, we can transfer it long distances in wires, and we can use it to power complex devices. Starting with the invention of the lightbulb, the phone, and the electric motor, our electricity demand became enormous. </p>

    <p>Once again, we cannot create energy, but we can transform the energy in our environment into electricity. Over time we have developed many methods for producing electricity, but they all are surprisingly similar. Hydro, nuclear, fossil fuels, and wind turbines all use the same base process to turn different types of energy into electricity. They all eventually create rotational motion that runs an electric generator.

    </p>

    <h2 class = "sectionTitle">Hydro Power</h2>
    <p>To produce hydropower, humans create a water reservoir by building a dam to control the flow of water along a river. The pool of water behind the dam contains a massive amount of potential energy. To produce energy, holes in the dam open up and let water flow downriver. This water flows over a turbine and causes it to spin. The turbine is attached to an electric generator which produces electricity. </p>

    <h2 class = "sectionTitle">Nuclear Power</h2>
    <p>In a nuclear reactor, nuclear fission is the first source of energy. Nuclear fission is a chain reaction involving the splitting of uranium atoms. A split atom releases gamma radiation, more neutrons, and two lighter nuclei with a lot of kinetic energy. To start the reactor, we fire a neutron at a uranium atom that splits and releases more neutrons that collide with more uranium. If the chain reaction is controlled, we can harvest the released energy. If the process is uncontrolled, then there can be a meltdown. Pools of water absorb the released energy and heat up, creating steam. This steam expands and rises and pushes past a turbine, spinning it. The turbine is attached to an electric generator which produces electricity.</p>

    <h2 class = "sectionTitle">Fossil Fuels</h2>
    <p>Fossil fuels are the compacted remains of ancient algae and other organisms. What are Fossil Fuels? These organisms died long ago and never decomposed. Their biomass was buried and compactified over millions of years. The energy of the organisms had nowhere to go and became stored as chemical energy in a very stable and dense form. Humans gather fossil fuels in their various forms and bring them to power plants. Here they are burned, and chemical energy from millions of years ago is released in one big burst. The released energy heats water and makes steam. The steam then turns a turbine connected to a generator to produce electricity. </p>

    <h2 class = "sectionTitle">Biofuels</h2>
    <p>Biofuels use a very similar process to fossil fuels. The difference is that the fuel comes from organic matter that was recently alive. This difference means that the carbon released from burning biofuels doesn’t add to greenhouse gasses because it was already active in the carbon cycle. Carbon Cycle There are three main ways to turn organic matter into energy. First, we can burn first raw scrap materials directly. Second, crops can be grown and turned into vegetable oil which is the key ingredient in biodiesel. Biodiesel is mainly used to run cars but could be burned for energy. The third method is to decompose the materials in a biodigester. Biodigesters use microbes to break down food and other organic waste. If this digestion is done anaerobically, it produces methane which can be burned to produce energy. The combustion of one methane molecule produces two carbon dioxide molecules. C02 is unfortunate, but it is better than methane. The global warming potential of methane is 21 times that of C02.

      The new C02 also has the potential to be captured by scrubbers. Scrubbers

    <h2 class = "sectionTitle">Wind Turbines</h2>
    <p>Wind turbines start with kinetic energy in the form of wind blowing across the land. The air molecules run into the blades of the turbine and push on them. This transfers the wind’s kinetic energy into the blade, and the blade spins. The turbine is connected to an electric generator which creates electricity. </p>

    <h2 class = "sectionTitle">Geothermal Energy</h2>
    <p>Geothermal energy captures the energy of hotspots underground. We pump water down to these hotspots and then bring it back up to use for power. When the water returns to the surface, the heat and the pressure drop turn it into steam. This process is very similar to geysers like in Yellowstone. The steam spins a turbine connected to a generator which creates electricity. Large-scale geothermal plants can produce electricity, but there are also small-scale systems that are used for heating. </p>

    <h2 class = "sectionTitle">Solar Power</h2>
    <p>Solar power is a bit of an oddball in that it doesn’t create rotation to power an electric generator. Electricity is instead generated by electromagnetic radiation

      from the Sun striking a solar panel. Solar panels consist of lots of small photovoltaic cells, which produce energy by the photovoltaic effect. This effect describes how photons that strike electron shells can excite the electrons into a higher state and potentially kick them off the shell altogether. When the Sun shines, it kicks electrons out of their shells, and these electrons are collected and flow down a copper wire to form electricity. This explanation was very hand-wavy.
