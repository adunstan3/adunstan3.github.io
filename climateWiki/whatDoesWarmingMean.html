    <h1>What Does Warming Mean?</h1>

    <p>What do we mean when we say the planet is getting warmer? The first important distinction is that climate change refers to the global climate, not the local weather. Climate is the average temperature over time, while the weather is the current temperature today. There are plenty of examples of public figures trying to use cold, snowy days as proof that climate change isn’t a big deal. Just because the planet on average is warming up doesn’t mean that a specific location at a particular time will be warmer. There is a possibility that if climate change becomes severe enough, Great Britain and other regions could become significantly colder.
      Impacts of Climate Change

      This is why people stopped referring to the problem as global warming. The old term was confusing and sometimes inaccurate. </p>

    <p>Another source of confusion is that the changes in temperature appear small at first glance. The International Panel on Climate Changes recommends that we limit the total warming to 1.5 degrees celsius. It can be challenging to understand why 1.5 degrees would make such a significant impact. Your local weather can change by much more than that from hour to hour. The key is that we are talking about global warming. The earth is vast to the point that it is hard for humans to understand the sizes at play. It takes a lot of energy to warm up an object as large as the earth. This extra energy in the earth system causes problems. According to skeptical science, the world is currently gaining energy at a rate of five atomic bombs per second. This rate is increasing as greenhouse gasses are continuously being emitted. The earth has warmed around 1 degree since pre-industrial times, and models predict we will reach 1.5 degrees of warming by 2030. This means that even at the ridiculous five bombs a second rate, the earth will still take a decade to warm .5 degrees. When we refer to degrees of warming, we are referring to incomprehensible amounts of energy.
