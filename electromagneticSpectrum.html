    <h1>Electromagnetic Spectrum</h1>
    <p><span class = "definition">Quick Def:</span> Electromagnetic radiation can take many forms depending on the wavelength. The spectrum is the collection of all wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.  </p>

    <br>
    <p>Radio waves, visible light, microwaves, and x-rays are all different versions of the same physical phenomena: electromagnetic radiation

      <span class = "discription">Electromagnetic Radiation</span> </a>

       The difference between these versions of radiation is their wavelength. Electromagnetic radiation switches from electric waves to magnetic waves and back. The distance that the radiation travels during a switch from electric to magnetic and back to electric is called the radiationâ€™s wavelength. The wavelength changes the way that the radiation interacts with the world. It is why visible light can be seen and why microwaves heat our food. </p>

    <p>We categorize all the different wavelengths of light on a chart going from short wavelengths to long wavelengths. This spectrum is continuous, but we group ranges of wavelengths that behave similarly into categories. From long to short wavelengths, the categories are </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Radio Waves: Used for long-distance communication and music</li>
      <li>Micro Waves: Used for heating up hot pockets</li>
      <li>Infrared Radiation: Day to day objects radiate heat at this wavelength
