    <h1>Planetary Energy Balance</h1>
    <p><span class = "definition">Quick Def:</span> The planet will try to reach a balance where the energy leaving the system is equal to the energy entering the system. </p>

    <p>When talking about the energy something contains, we refer to the collection of objects we are studying as the system. We refer to everything that is not the system (literally everything) as the surroundings. The coffee mug with hot coffee is a system; the rest of the universe is the surroundings. Energy cannot be created or destroyed. This law means that if the coffee mug (system) changed its net energy, the surroundings would have had to change oppositely. The mug pushed energy out to the room, or the room pushed energy into the mug. </p>

    <p>Objects like to emit and receive the same amount of energy. This principle intuitively makes sense. If your coffee cup continuously emitted more energy than it received, it would freeze on the counter. If the coffee cup continuously emitted less energy than it receives, the coffee would boil away. In the real world, if you leave your cup on the counter, it cools for a bit and then stays at one temperature. It cooled to the point where the energy given off by the cup was the same as the energy the room put into it. Once it reaches this equilibrium point, the coffee stays at the same temperature unless something about the room or the cup changes. </p>

    <p>This balance makes sense intuitively, but why does it happen scientifically? The Steven Boltzman equation tells us that the more energy an object has, the more energy it emits as EM radiation.

      <span class = "discription">Emittance</span> </a>
      As an object warms relative to its surroundings, the object's total emittance grows. This means energy emitted by the object is more than the energy received. When this happens, the object begins to lose energy and cool off. This loss of temperature lowers total emittance. This process of reactively increasing or decreasing emissivity always leads to an energy balance. The temperature will stabilize when the incoming energy is equal to the outgoing energy. </p>

    <p>In the real world, you may see systems where the input and output are unbalanced. After a recent disturbance, many systems need time to react and re-establish a balance. While your coffee is hot, it is an unbalanced system but left alone; it will cool off and tend towards equilibrium.</p>

    <p>We can apply this same logic to the earth as a system. Earth likes to be in a planetary energy balance where the amount of energy received from the sun is the same as the energy lost to space from radiation. </p>
