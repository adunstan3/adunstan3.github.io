    <p><span class = "definition">Quick Def:</span> Solar cells capture energy by using sunlight to knock electrons off of atoms. These electrons are turned into a current through the use of a p-n junction. </p>

    <p>Any power generation technique has to trap energy from the environment and then turn it into electricity. Most power sources have a unique method for trapping energy from the environment, but they all mainly use the same process for turning that energy into electricity. Solar doesn't use an electrical generator which means it has its method for trapping energy and turning that energy into electricity. </p>

    <p>Let's start with trapping energy. Solar panels are made of lots of small photovoltaic cells wired together. The photovoltaic cells are able to trap energy in sunlight with the photovoltaic effect. This effect is where electrons absorb EM radiation

      and move to a higher energy state. In photovoltaic cells, sunlight comes in contact with phosphorus atoms which want to give up an electron. These phosphorus atoms are suspended in a silicon crystal structure. When the radiation hits the phosphorus, electrons can break free from the atom entirely, and the atom becomes a positive ion. The energy has successfully been captured, but there is no way to power anything since these electrons are just sitting around in the crystal structure.
      </p>

    <p>Turning this energy into electricity is a bit more challenging. The key discovery that made solar panels possible is the p-n junction. The phosphorus forming positive ions acts as the p side. To create the n side, we add a second layer of silicon below the first. This layer is laced with boron atoms which need one electron to complete their shells. If they receive one of these electrons, they become negative ions. At the junction between the p and the n, electrons move from the phosphorus to the boron since these atoms are close enough together. The phosphorus and the boron create positive and negative charges, making an electric field through the entire cell. This field pushes free electrons in the solar cell towards the top of the p side. </p>

    <p>In the p side of the cell, the sun knocks electrons off the phosphorus, and they move upwards to the top of the p side. At the p-n junction, the sun can knock electrons off the boron and the phosphorus. This creates free electrons and boron atoms with holes that want electrons. The electric field in the cell pushes the free electrons upward before they can fill the holes of the boron. Any electrons on the n side creating negative boron ions get knocked off the ion and pulled up to make boron ions at the p-n junction. After enough time, all the electrons end up at the top of the p side, and all the boron that wants electrons ends up at the bottom of the n side. When a wire connects the p side to the n side, the electrons flow from the n to the p, creating current and electricity. As long as the sun continues to knock electrons off atoms at the p-n junction, this electron flow will continue. </p>

    <p>Modern solar panels use a skinny n side with a high concentration of phosphorus and a very thick p side with a low concentration of boron. The goal is to maximize the amount of light that can reach the p-n junction. Solar panels also string together individual photovoltaic cells to form a flat sheet. The panel is held together by a frame and protected by glass and then mounted in a sunny area. </p>
